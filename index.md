# Mission
Our <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">MISSION</span> is to improve the understanding and treatment of cancer by harnessing the power of computer intelligence. Guided by our vision that computers will be able think and do just as humans can, we strive to develop innovative therapies and identify target populations by building systems model of tumors through the use of AI and statistical approaches, while collaborating with other researchers in this pursuit. We will be recognized for fostering a transdisciplinary, diverse, and collegial environment.


# Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our team's latest research publication is now available in Cancer Discovery. Our work delves into the discovery of bipotent drugs as a new solution for traditional combination therapies, targeting two oncogenic pathways at once.

Our team has leveraged cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques to predict patient responses to immunotherapy. These methods consider the activity of bipotent targets within tumors, delivering a more tailored approach to cancer treatment.

This publication introduces a fresh perspective to the field of cancer therapy, augmenting the current targeted and immunotherapy treatments. Read our work now in Cancer Discovery and be at the forefront of the latest advancements in cancer research.
